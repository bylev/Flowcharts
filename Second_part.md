# SECOND PART OF HW

2. Write with your own words the difference among them:

if-else vs switch, (4 marks)

if-else statements selects the execution of the statesments based on upon the evaluation of the expression if sth. While switch selects the statements according to a keyboard command. 

do-while vs while vs for. (6 marks)  

  Do-while, while and for does the same thing except for one difference. The do-while and while runs atleast once **in** any condition, even if it's false. But for is only for true conditions, as soon as the condition became false, the control goes out of for. 

3. Draw 3 modified flowcharts (cite your reference) and 4 original flowcharts using at least two control structures (for this part include all previous flowcharts you drawed and showed in class, UPDATED).

The **3 flowcharts** I showed in class is on the pictures of the first part of part two.
