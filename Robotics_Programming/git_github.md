In this markdown, we will talk about how github works and how can you create your own repository. 

## REPOSITORY
- How to create a repository?
1. Log into [github](https://github.com/dashboard) and choose "New Repository".
2. Select *Create New (+)* and then select *New Repository*.
3. In the page "New Repository", 
4. In the "Repository name", indicate -   `CodeDeployGitHubDemo`.
5. Select *Public* 
6. Desactivate the section *Initialize this repository with a README*.
7. Choose *Create a repository*

## BRANCH 

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

- How to create a branch?
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Optionally, if you want to create your new branch from a branch other than the default branch for the repository, click **_NUMBER_  branches** then choose another branch.
3. Click on the branch selector menu. 
4. Type a unique name for your new branch, then select *Create branch*

## COMMIT
`git commit` creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times.

- How git commit works?
1. Commits are the building blocks of "save points" within Git's version control.

```bash
git commit -m "update the README.md with link to contributing guide"
````
2.  Click  `text.md`  file.
3.  Click the pencil icon  _(Edit this file)_.
4.  Write your modications.
5.  Write a commit message that describes your changes.
6.  Click  **Commit changes**  button.
